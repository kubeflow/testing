# GitOps Files for Machine
This folder includes all the files that can **NOT** be modified by users, and can only be generated by `make optional-generate`.

The file organization is simliar to User folder, only differs in CRD stage:

```
clusters
  - A cluster
    - namespaces
      - a namespace
        - All CRD files
      - b namespace
      ...
  - B cluster
  ...
```
