# To setup the appropriate GSA in our test infra management cluster
# we deviated from the GCP Kubeflow blueprint.
#
# We used the service account "kubeflow-testing@kubeflow-ci.iam.gserviceaccount.com"
# so we don't need to create a namespace specific google service account.
#
# We also granted permissions to this GSA on the folder ci-projects and not on individual 
# projects. Likewise we added the workload identity binding to this GSA for the
# CNRM KSA.
#
# We did that through the Cloud console and gcloud so we don't have YAML specs
# for it.
