    1. Do not use kubectl to edit this configmap, because some values are used
    during kustomize build. Instead, change the configmap and apply the entire
    kustomize manifests again.
    2. After updating the configmap, some deployments may need to be restarted
    until the changes take effect. A quick way to restart all deployments in a
    namespace: `kubectl rollout restart deployment -n <your-namespace>`.
