## Kubeflow CD with tektoncd pipelines

This directory contains Tekton pipelines intended to rebuild Kubeflow docker images 
and open PRs to update Kubeflow kustomize manifests to use the newly built images.


### Use Cases

The following use cases can be run on the following components (should be run from the components directory):
- `kustomize build --reorder none `*centraldashboard*`/ci   | kubectl apply -f -`
- `kustomize build --reorder none `*jupyter-web-app*`/ci    | kubectl apply -f -`
- `kustomize build --reorder none `*notebook-controller*`/ci | kubectl apply -f -`
- `kustomize build --reorder none `*profile-controller*`/ci | kubectl apply -f -

This uses TektonCD [pipelinerun](https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/blob/master/docs/pipelineruns.md) to enable the following use case:

1. A PR is merged into kubeflow/kubeflow updating the component
1. The merged commit is 1234
1. This tekton pipelinerun is triggered to build the component image from commit @1234.
1. The pipelinerun edits manifests/common/centraldashboard/base/kustomization.yaml (using kubeflow-bot repo) and adds the new image tag
1. The pipelinerun calls `make generate; make test` 
1. If successful then 
1.   The pipeline checks in the changes 
1.   Opens a PR with the updated kubeflow/manifests that uses the newly built image
1.   Approvers LGTM the PR to kubeflow/manifests and it gets merged

### Background information on TektonCD pipelineruns, pipelines and tasks

A TektonCD PipelineRun takes 1 Pipeline and N PipelineResources.
The PipelineResources can be git repos, git pull requests, docker images.
These resources are made available to the Pipeline via PipelineRun.

The general relationship between TektonCD resources is shown below:

```
── PipelineRun
   ├── PipelineResources
   └── Pipeline
       └── Tasks
```

In this use case the following instance is created:

```
── ci-centraldashboard-pipeline-run
   ├── resources
   │   ├── image
   │   │   └── component
   │   └── git 
   │       ├── kubeflow+revision
   │       └── manifests+revision 
   └── pipeline
       └── tasks
           ├── build-push      
```

The PipelineRun includes a Pipeline that has 1 tasks and 3 PipelineResources of type image (component) and git (kubeflow, manifests). The Tasks reference these resources in their inputs or outputs. 

### Parameterization 

The PipelineRun uses parameterized PipelineResources which are passed down to the the Pipeline and Tasks.
The Pipeline uses parameterized Tasks.
Reusing this pipeline only requires changing parameters in params.env in the target component

The parameters are noted below, those with an asterix should change per component:
Those parameters without an asterix allow different gcr.io locations and namespace.

```
  container_image=gcr.io/kubeflow-ci/test-worker:latest
* docker_target=serve
* image_name=centraldashboard
  image_url=gcr.io/kubeflow_public_images
* kubeflow_repo_revision=1234
* kubeflow_repo_url=git@github.com:kubeflow/kubeflow.git
* manifests_repo_revision=master
* manifests_repo_url=git@github.com:kubeflow/manifests.git
  namespace=kubeflow-test-infra
* path_to_context=components/centraldashboard
* path_to_docker_file=components/centraldashboard/Dockerfile
* path_to_manifests_dir=common/centraldashboard/base
  pvc_mount_path=/kubeflow
```

### Setting up a cluster to run the pipelines

The kustomize manifests are currently written so as to run in a Kubeflow releasing cluster.

The current release cluster is

* **project**: **kf-releasing**
* **cluster**: **kf-releasing-0-6-2**
* **namespace**: **kf-releasing**

This is a Kubeflow cluster (v0.6.2) and we rely on that to configure certain things like the secrets and service accounts.

1. Follow [Tektons' instructions](https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/blob/master/docs/auth.md#ssh-authentication-git) for
   creating a secret containing ssh credentials for use with GitHub

   * We are currently using the secret named **kubeflow-bot-github-ssh**


1. Ensure the GCP service account used with Kaniko has storage admin permissions for the project
   where the images are pushed.

   * most likely **gcr.io/kubeflow-images-public**

1. Create a secret named **github-token** containing a github token to be used by the hub CLI to create PRs.

### Run a pipeline

1. Modify `base/params.env`

   * set namespace to the namespace where it will run

1. Run
    
   ```
   kustomize build --reorder none `*profile-controller*`/ci | kubectl apply -f -
   ```

### Create a pipeline run for a specific commit

Let `APPDIR` be the directory for the specific application e.g.

```
COMMIT=<commit to build at>
APPDIR=components/profile-controller
```

1. Create the overlay directory
    
   ```
   mkdir -p ${APPDIR}/ci-g${COMMIT}
   ```

1. Modify `${APPDIR}/ci-g${COMMIT}/params.env`

 
   * **kubeflow_repo_revision**: Set this to the commit to build at.
   * **image_url**: This to the full URL of the image e.g **gcr.io/kubeflow-images-public/profile-controller@vmaster-g1795828**
