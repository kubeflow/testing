# Kubeflow Testing

This repository hosts shared CI building blocks for the Kubeflow community: reusable GitHub Actions
and scripts that any Kubeflow Subproject can consume from its own `.github/workflows` or `Makefile`.
The goal is to reduce duplication across Kubeflow repositories and to give the maintainers one place
to align on CI best practices.

## Common Scripts

The following scripts are available.

### Checking license headers

Every source file needs the Apache 2.0 header from `hack/boilerplate/`. New files must use the
year-less header (`Copyright The Kubeflow Authors.`). The verifier rejects a hardcoded year on
files added relative to the base branch.

Run this script as follows:

```bash
python hack/boilerplate/boilerplate.py --base-ref master
```

Vendored third-party code that must keep its upstream license header can be skipped with
`--exclude`, which takes a Python regular expression matched (with `re.search`) against each
file's repository-relative path. Repeat the flag for multiple patterns:

```bash
python hack/boilerplate/boilerplate.py --base-ref main \
  --exclude '^third_party/' \
  --exclude '^internal/starrocks/mysqldriver/'
```

## Common GitHub Actions

The following GitHub actions are available.

### verify-boilerplate

Runs the license header check above against the calling repository. Check out the repository
with `fetch-depth: 0` first so the base branch can be resolved:

```yaml
- uses: actions/checkout@v5
  with:
    fetch-depth: 0
- uses: kubeflow/testing/.github/actions/verify-boilerplate@<commit-sha>
  with:
    base-reference: main
    # Optional: one regular expression per line; blank lines and # comments are ignored.
    exclude: |
      ^third_party/
      # Vendored go-sql-driver/mysql (MPL-2.0); keeps its upstream header.
      ^internal/starrocks/mysqldriver/
```
